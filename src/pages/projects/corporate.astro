                    A table that provides varying moods based on light alone.
                    <br />
                    The adjustable light bar when slightly raised offers ambient
                    lighting perfect for a more casual vibe while hosting parties
                    or late-night conversations.

                As the bar is raised higher, it provides a more functional
                amount of light, turning the workspace into a well-lit area to
                work on.

                The inspiration for the Aura table was drawn from common study
                areas in libraries, where lighting arrangements provide ample
                downward light without being intrusive.
