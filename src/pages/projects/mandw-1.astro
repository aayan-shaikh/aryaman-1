                    "This signage concept humorously conveys a visual
                    distinction between toilet usage habits typically associated
                    with women and men:

                    <div class="card">
                        Left side ("W"): The toilet seat is down, suggesting how
                        women generally leave (or expect) the toilet seat to be
                        â€” down and ready to sit on.
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        Right side ("M"): Both the seat and lid are up, which is
                        commonly associated with how men leave the toilet after
                        standing up to urinate.
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The visual acts as a lighthearted commentary on a common
                        household debate or cultural difference regarding toilet
                        seat etiquette between genders." -ChatGPT
